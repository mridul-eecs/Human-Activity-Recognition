# Human-Activity-Recognition

In this repository, I will show you how to develop an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for signal based time series data.
The dataset choosen for the project is from "UCI machine learning repository"
Link of the dataset is as follows:

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline includes the following stages.
1. Data Gathering: Collecting data and making them available for the data-scientists for further analysis
2. Data Analysis: Understanding the data and extracting intuitions from it.
3. Feature Engineering: Transforming variables to make them ready for machine learning algorithms
4. Model building: Model building is based on bussiness value evaluation and prediction requirements.
5. Model deployment: Finally the model is deployed in the cloud which can be accessed using APIs.
